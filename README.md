# Monocular-Depth-Estimation-using-Transfer-Learning
We estimate the dense depth map of each pixel using a single monocular RGB image using a transfer learning based deep learning approach. The Encoder-Decoder architecture is used as the underlying framework. The NYU dataset V2 is used for training the depth estimation models.
